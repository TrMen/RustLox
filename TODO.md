- Run in valgrind to detect memory leaks
- Optimize
- Run an integration test suite
- Implement optimization for constant strings borrowing the src code
  - `String` becomes `enum (String, &'a str)`
  - If we wanted to make the code compile to a binary, it could easily borrow the constant section then
- Deduplicate strings
